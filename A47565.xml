            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT was the ſpecial Charge God gave to his people of old, that the many ſignal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vioences and Mercies that they had received from him, ſhould by them be recorded and left to their Childrens Children, to that end, that the memorial of his goodneſs might cauſe them to love and fear his Name, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are required to bleſs the Lord from the Fountain of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from the very beginning of all his Favours towards them; and it is no ſmall favour the Servants of God are made partakers of, that his people of old have left ſo many teſtimonies of the gracious goodneſs and Providences of God towards them, they being a means to ſtrengthen the Faith of his People, in a dependency upon him in all thoſe variety of diſpenſations that do attend them in this World; that whatever troubles they
<pb facs="tcp:41774:3"/>
meet withall in this Life, they may know that God deals no otherwiſe with them than be hath done to thoſe that formerly have feared his Name, and may be comforted with the ſame comforts and ſupports which his Servants for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly have received from God. The Author of theſe enſuing Experiences, was that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and faithful Servant of God, Mr. <hi>Hanſerd Knollys,</hi> who departed this Life in the <hi>93d.</hi> year of his Age, having bin employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Works and Service of Chriſt, as a faithful Miniſter for above <hi>60</hi> Years, in which time he laboured without fainting under all the diſcouragements that attended him, being contented in all conditions, tho' never ſo poor in this World, under all perſecutions and ſufferings, ſo he might therein ſerve his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord and Saviour. I have my ſelf known him for above <hi>54</hi> years, and can witneſs to the Truth of many things left by him under his own hand; st is great pity that the laſt <hi>20</hi> years of his Life cannot be found amongſt his Writings, which to the knowledge of many were attended with the ſame fufferings as formerly, and with the ſame holy Behaviours under them; he in that time was a Priſoner in the <hi>New-Priſon</hi> for the Truths ſake many months, where with great chearfulneſs he remained, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting and encouraging all that came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit him, with many bleſſed Exhortations to
<pb facs="tcp:41774:3"/>
cleave to the Lord; none were ſent empty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way without ſome ſpiritual Instructions, and many of his Fellow-priſoners were greatly strengthened and comforted by that heavenly Counſel that dropped from his lsps, ſpending much of his time there in Prayer and Study of the Word of God, daily preaching to them the things that concern the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>He was choſen an Elder to a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>London,</hi> with whom he laboured for near <hi>50</hi> years, under many difficulties that dsd attend him, but neither the poverty of the Church, nor the Perſecutions that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, were any temptation to him to neglect his Duty towards them, but was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be poor with them in their poverty, and to ſuffer with them in their ſufferings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being willing to labour for his own and his Families Bread, by keeping a School, when they were not able to ſupply his wants, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho he wanted not opportunity to have advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced himſelf in the World, if he would have accepted of them; but like a faithful Paſtor he choſe rather to be poor, and ſuffer affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, than to leave the Duty and Work he was called unto, in which he was employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, untill he arrived to the age of above Ninety years, and when he found weakneſſes attend him, his love and affection to that poor Church was ſuch, that he was daily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing
<pb facs="tcp:41774:4"/>
his thoughts to have an able Miniſter for them in his room; declaring to ſeveral of his Friends what great ſatisfaction it would be to him, to ſee one ſettled amongſt them, and that he would be willing to part with ſomething of that little which he had (if there was need) for his Maintenance of the Church, towards the ſupply of him: And it pleaſed God to provide one for them, to his great ſatisfaction and rejoycing. And ſo great was his natural affection, and tender care for his Daughter and Grand-children, who he knew were like to come to ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, that he did accordingly at that great Age again undertake the Teaching of a School, that he might do to the uttermoſt of his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to provide for them.</p>
            <p>And having finiſhed his Work, he fell aſleep in the Lord, the <hi>19th.</hi> of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1691.</hi> That theſe Experiences may be of uſe to all thoſe that read the ſame, is the Deſire and Prayer of</p>

            <head>THE LIFE and DEATH OF Mr. <hi>Hanſerd Knollys.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I <hi>Hanſerd Knollys</hi> was Born at <hi>Calkwell</hi> near <hi>Loweth</hi> in <hi>Lincoln-ſhire,</hi> and was removed thence with my Parents to <hi>Schartho</hi> near <hi>Market Grymsby</hi> in the ſame County. About the ſixth Year of my Age I fell into a great Pond, and was preſerved from being drowned by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bearing up my Coats, till my Father came, leaped in, and pulled me out. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the tenth Year of my Age I having conſtrued the 35th. chap. of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in my <hi>Latin Bible</hi> to my Father, he took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to diſſwade me from the love and uſe of ſtrong Drink, and ſaid he would give me 20 <hi>l.</hi> if I would drink water, but withall told me he would not have me do
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41774:5"/>
it to the prejudice of my Health, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me to make no Vow to God ſo to do for I did not underſtand how Sacred a thing a Vow is, and how it did bind the Soul, and it would be Sin not to perform my Vow: whereupon I drunk water eleven years, and never in all that time drank any Wine, nor ſtrong Drink. About that time my Father kept a Tutor in his Houſe, to teach me and my Brother, who was a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and conſcientious Young Man; He gave us good Inſtructions for our Souls, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced us of the Sin of <hi>Sabbath-breaking,</hi> and of Diſobedience to our Parents. After my Father had preferred our Tutor to a place of greater Profit, we went a little while to <hi>Grymsby Free-School,</hi> till my Father got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Tutor for us into his Houſe; and one day going to the Free-School we fell out, and fought: upon which I was much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that we had ſinned againſt God, and againſt our Father, who had often told us we were Brethren, and ought not to <hi>Fall out by the way:</hi> And I ſaid, Brother, we have ſinned, come let us be Friends, and pray God to pardon this, and other our Sins; whereupon we both kneeled down upon the plowed Land, and I prayed, wept and made Supplication to God, as well as I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41774:5"/>
could, and found ſo great Aſſiſtance from God at that time, that I never uſed any ſet Form of Prayer afterwards; which done, we both kiſſed each other, and went to School.</p>
            <p>Afterwards I went to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and there a godly Miniſter preached on <hi>Hoſea</hi> the 5th. Chap. and 17. <hi>ver.</hi> His Doctrine was, <hi>That the joyning to Sin by often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it after Conviction of Conſcience for it, did provoke God to give over many to the power of their Corruptions, and let them alone to dye in their Sins.</hi> I was thereby convinced that it was my Caſe, for I had oftentimes broken the Sabbath after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and I had diſobeyed my Parents, and had often told Untruths. The ſame Lords-day at Night, another godly Miniſter preached at five a Clock upon <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. and thereby I was much more convinced of my ſinful Condition, and that I was a Child of Wrath, without Chriſt and Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Work of Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction remained ſtrongly upon me above one year, under which I was filled with great Horrour, and fears of Hell, ſore buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fettings and Temptations of the Devil, and made to poſſeſs the Sins of my Youth. But yet I prayed daily, heard all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41774:6"/>
Miniſters I could, read and ſearched the Holy Scriptures, read good Books, got acquaintance with gracious Chriſtians, then called <hi>Puritans,</hi> kept ſeveral days of Faſting and Prayer alone, wherein I did humble my Soul for my Sins, and begg'd Pardon and Grace of God for Chriſts ſake; grew ſtrict in performing Holy Duties, and in Reformation of my own Life, exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my ſelf every night, confeſſing my Sins, and mourning for them, and had a great Zeal for God, and an Indignation againſt Actual Sins, both committed by my ſelf and others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 29th. 1629. I was ordained Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, and the next day, <hi>June</hi> 30th. I was ordained Presbyter by the Biſhop of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terborow,</hi> having Preached above 16 Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons before I would be Ordained, by way of Tryal of my Ability for that great Work of the Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>After my Ordination, the Biſhop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi> gave me a ſmall Living at <hi>Humber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> where I preached twice every Lords Day, and once every Holy-day: That which made me ſtrict and Laborious in Preaching, was partly the Work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction upon my Conſcience, but more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially a Providential Acquaintance, that I had gotten with a very godly old Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41774:6"/>
in <hi>Gainsburgh,</hi> where I taught the Free-School, before I came to <hi>Humber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> who told me of one called a <hi>Brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt,</hi> who uſed to pray and expound Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in his Family, whom I went ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to hear, and with whom I had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and very good Counſel. Whilſt I was at <hi>Humberſtone,</hi> there lived a very Religious Widow, who falling ſick, ſent for me, and charged me that I would not depart her Houſe on the day-time until ſhe ended or mended, leaſt Satan ſhould tempt her above her ſtrength. The Doctor of Phyſick had given her over, ſome godly Miniſters, Friends and Relations did take leave of her as a Dying Woman. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived nothing for ſeveral days, but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Julep, which was put into her Mouth with a Spoon, and ran moſt of it out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, lay ſpeechleſs two or three days; her Family mourning over her, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting her Death every Hour: I had brought ſome of my Books to her Houſe, and was ſtudying her Funeral Sermon: and when I had almoſt finiſhed the ſame, the Devil ſet upon me with a violent Suggeſtion, That the Scriptures are not the Word of God; He had ſuggeſted this Temptation to me divers Times before, but prevailed not:

Now the Tempter aſſaulted me with this Argument; Whatever you ask in the Name of Chriſt, God will do it, but that Scripture was not true; and if I would put it now upon Tryal, I ſhould find it not to be true, for if I would ask the Womans Life in the Name of Chriſt, God will not do it, and thereby I ſhould know, the Scriptures are not true, nor are they the Word of God, for his Word is true. To which I anſwered, Satan, thou art a Lyar, a Deceiver, and a falſe Accuſer. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures are the Word of God, and the Scriptures of Truth: And ſeeing thou haſt often tempted me in this kind, and now doſt aſſault me again, that I may for ever ſilence thee, thou wicked and lying Devil, I will truſt in God, and act Faith in the Name of Chriſt in that very Word of his Truth which thou haſt now ſuggeſted. I will leave my Study, and go and pray for her, and believe that God will hear my Prayers thrô the Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, and reſtore her Life and Health, that thou mayſt be found a Lyar: Whereupon I went into the Parlour where ſhe lay ſpeechleſs, without any viſible motion, or uſe of any Senſes; and I locked the Door, and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles being in the Room, I kneeled down

by her Bed-ſide, and prayed above half an hour, uſing my Voice, and then ſhe began to ſtir, toſs, and ſtruggled ſo much, that I was conſtrained to ſtand up, and holding her in her Bed, ſtill prayed over her: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than then gave me a great Interruption, and ſuggeſted to me ſhe was a dying, and theſe were the pangs of Death upon her; I notwithſtanding this Aſſault of the Devil, was aſſiſted by the Holy Spirit to pray and believe ſtill, and in a ſhort time ſhe lay very quietly, and I kneeled down again and prayed fervently, and within half an hour, whilſt I was yet praying, ſhe ſaid, <hi>The LORD hath healed me, I am reſtored to Health:</hi> Then I returned praiſes to God, and ſhe did joyn with me, lifting up her eyes and hands, ſtill ſaying, I am Healed. Then I roſe up from my knees, and asked her how ſhe did: <hi>O Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>God hath heard your Prayers, and hath made me whole.

            <p>The next Year after this, I Married a Wife, with whom I lived 40 years, by whom I had Iſſue, 7 Sons, and 3 Daughters, who was a Holy, Diſcreet Woman, and a meet Help for me, in the ways of her Houſhold, and alſo in the way of Holineſs; who was my companion in all my Sufferings,

Travels, and Hardſhips that we endured for the Goſpel: She departed this Life the 30th. of <hi>April,</hi> 1671. in full Aſſurance of Eternal Life and Salvation.</p>
            <p>Preſently after I was Married, I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of ſome things about the Worſhip of God (which I had conformed unto,) to be ſinful, to wit, the Surplice, the Croſs in Baptiſm, and admitting wicked perſons to the Lords Supper, whereupon I reſigned my Living to the Biſhop, who offered me a better Living: I told him I could not conform any longer, and would do nothing but preach, which he connived at for two or three Years. Shortly after I was convinced that my Ordination received from the Biſhop was not right, and thô I had preached ſome years by Virtue of that Ordination, I had not received any Seal from Chriſt of my Miniſtry; for thô many had been reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and moralized, yet I knew not that I had been Inſtrumental to convert any Souls to God: And thereupon I renounced that Ordination, and ſilenced my ſelf, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not to preach any more, untill I had a clear Call and Commiſſion from Chriſt to preach the Goſpel. And to that end I gave my ſelf to Prayer day and night, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

weeks together, and at laſt being at Prayer in a Wood at <hi>Woodenderby</hi> in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln-ſhire,</hi> where I had preached before, and prayed with loud cries and tears, that Chriſt would count me worthy, and put me into the Miniſtry, and ſhew me how to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God in the Miniſtry; and thô I was much melted and enlarged in Prayer at that time, yet I had no anſwer from the Lord: After Prayer I walked and meditated under the Wood-ſide till Sun-ſet, and then went homeward, reſolved not to preach, till the Lord made my call to that great Work of preaching the Goſpel clear to me. And as I was going home, an anſwer of my Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers was given to me in theſe words, <hi>Go to Mr. Wheelwright, and he ſhall tell thee, and ſhew thee how to glorifie God in the Miniſtry;</hi> but I heard no voice, nor did I ſee any Viſion; only thoſe words were plainly and articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lately ſpoken into my Ears and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: At which I was aſtoniſhed, and ſaid, Lord let me not be deluded, nor deceived; then was brought to my mind that paſſage of <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſent to <hi>Peter,</hi> who ſhould tell him what he ſhould do; whereupon I was fully perſwaded it was an anſwer of my Prayets from the Lord, and I was filled with ſuch joy, that I went on my way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41774:9"/>
leaping and praiſing God. The next Morning going to ſeek out Mr. <hi>Wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,</hi> who was a ſilenced Miniſter, whom I had heard of by ſome Chriſtians, that he had been Inſtrumental to convert many Souls, but I knew him not, nor did I know where he was, but I was reſolved to find him out, for I had heard that he was near <hi>Lincoln,</hi> about 25 miles from me, where he lived privately: And as I was getting up on Horſeback, one of my Neighbours coming by asked me whither I was riding, to whom I ſaid I did not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know, I was going to Mr. <hi>Wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,</hi> who was, as I heard, about <hi>Lincoln,</hi> No, ſald he, Mr. <hi>Wheelwhright</hi> and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily came to dwell at a Village which was but three miles from my houſe, for, ſaid he, I ſaw him come thither but three nights ſince, with his Family and houſhold goods in a Coach and a Wagon. Thither I rid preſently, and found it ſo; and I told Mr. <hi>Wheelwright,</hi> that yeſternight I was pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as before, and was ſent unto him by the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And after he had asked me ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things about the Work of God upon my Soul, and I had told him; he ſaid I could not glorifie God neither in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, nor in any other way or Work for I
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41774:10"/>
was building my Soul upon a Covenant of Works, and was a ſtranger to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace: At which I was ſtartled, troubled, and ſomewhat amazed, but I told him I was aſſured God had ſent me to him, and by his mouth I ſhould be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how to glorifie God in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel; and I did earneſtly intreat and beſeech him to apply himſelf to give me his Counſel and directions touching that Matter.</p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Wheelwright</hi> opened to me the Nature of the Covenant of Free Grace, which I confeſſed to him I was a ſtranger to in a great meaſure, having bin only under legal Convictions, and a Spirit of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; and tho' I had ſome diſcoveries of my want of Chriſt, yet I had ſought Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs as it were by the Works of the Law, and got my peace by performing du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and reſted on them. Mr. <hi>Wheelwright</hi> deſired me to conſider what he had ſaid to me, and to come to him 2 or 3 days after: So I left him at that time, and went home exceeding ſorrowful about my Souls Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but I gave my ſelf to Prayer, and begged of God to teach me the Covenant of Grace, and to that end I ſearched the Scriptures, and I heard one Mr. <hi>How</hi> preach

upon <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I live by the Faith of the Son of God;</hi> whereby I ſaw that I had lived a Life of Works, and not of Faith. Then I began to ſee a neceſſity of believing in Chriſt for pardon and Salvation; and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Miniſter ſay, that Chriſt was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, Root, and only Foundation of Saving Faith, and that God did give the Faith of <hi>Evidence, Heb.</hi> 11.1. in ſome New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. and that thoſe Promiſes were given of God, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. I prayed that Night, and next Morning, and in the night ſeaſon, that God would give me ſuch a promiſe. The next day I lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſelf in the Church, and in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, or Quire ſo called, I prayed very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, mourning and bemoaning my ſelf and my Souls Condition, fearing, and with great brokenneſs of Spirit, and many tears expreſſed my fears, that God would leave me and forſake me, and then I ſhould ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly periſh for ever: And then that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee,</hi> was given me, which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſtopt me a little in Prayer, and I brake forth into this kind of Expoſtulation with God, ſaying, Lord who am I! I am a vile ſinful Sinner, the chief of Sinners, moſt unworthy of Pardon and Salvation! How,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41774:11"/>
Lord! never leave me, nor forſake me? O infinite Mercy! Oh Free Grace! who am I? I have bin a graceleſs Soul, a formal Profeſſor, a legal performer of Holy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and have gone about to eſtabliſh mine own Righteouſneſs, which I now ſee is but filthy Rags, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then God gave me thoſe two Promiſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.22, 23, 24, 25. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.9, 10. and filled my Soul with joy and peace in believing, ſo that I brake forth into praiſes and Thankſgiving.</p>
            <p>The next day I went again to Mr. <hi>Wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,</hi> and told him what God had done for my poor Soul, who ſaid unto me, now I was ſomewhat prepared to preach Jeſus Chriſt and the Goſpel of Free Grace to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, having bin taught it of God, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard and learned Jeſus Chriſt my ſelf. And he adviſed me to wait ſtill upon God in Prayer, and Chriſt would appear again to me by his Holy Spirit in his Word, and ſhew me and teach me how to preach; then I went home again, and continued in Prayer: And one day begging earneſtly of God in Prayer, that if he had deſigned me to that great Work of preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that then he would give me ſome Teſtimony out of his Holy Word of his calling me thereunto; whereupon thoſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41774:11"/>
words were ſpoken by his Spirit to my Heart, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.16. <hi>I have appeared unto thee for this purpoſe, to make thee a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and a Witneſs both of thoſe things which thou haſt ſeen, and of thoſe things in which I will appear unto thee;</hi> whence I believed that now I had received a Call and Commiſſion from my Lord Jeſus Chriſt to preach the Goſpel of his Free Grace: And I bleſſed God, and expected a further Appearance of Jeſus Chriſt unto me. That Night in my ſleep Chriſt put into my mind, that the next Lords day I ſhould preach on that Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. And he dictated to me in my ſleep, what Doctrine I ſhould preach from that Text. The next day I went and told all this to Mr. <hi>Wheelwright,</hi> who ſaid, Now my beloved Brother, and Fellow Labourer in the Goſpel of the Grace of God, Chriſt hath given you Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, a Call and a Commiſſion to preach: I pray you be humble and holy, and delay not to do your Maſters Work, or words to that effect. That Night in my Sleep the Lord taught me more, and the third night alſo; and I retained it all in my Memory, and writ it down, and ſearched the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which I received in my ſleep for the Confirmation of my Doctrine: And the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41774:12"/>
next day being the Lords Day, I preached that which I had received from the Lord, and God made it uſeful and powerful to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, as appeared to me afterwards. Thus I was night by night taught of God to preach the Doctrine of Free Grace, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Tenor of the new and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant for three or four years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, whereby very many Sinners were Converted, and many Believers were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the Faith: in which three or four years ſpace I preached in three ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, at <hi>Wood-enderby,</hi> at <hi>Fulleby</hi> on the Hill, and at <hi>Wainfleel,</hi> where I was ſilenced, and from thence removed to <hi>London,</hi> and thence to <hi>New-England,</hi> with my Wife and one Child.</p>
            <p>About the Year 1636. I was perſecuted, and proſecuted in the High Commiſſion Court, by vertue of a Warrant where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I was apprehended in <hi>Boſton,</hi> and kept a Priſoner in the Man's Houſe who ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Warrant upon me: But God helped me to convince him, and he was ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly terrified in his Conſcience, that he ſet open his doors and let me go away; but before I went, I tarried ſo long in <hi>London,</hi> waiting for a paſſage, that when I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board I had but 6 braſs farthings left, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41774:12"/>
no Silver nor Gold, only my Wife had 5 <hi>l.</hi> that I knew not of, which ſhe gave me when we came there: By the way my little Child dyed with Convulſion fits, our Beer and Water ſtank, our Bisket was green, yellow and blew, moulded and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and our Cheeſe alſo, ſo that we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered much hardſhip, being 12 weeks in our paſſage; but God was gracious to us, and lead us ſafe thro' thoſe great Deeps, and e're we went aſhore, came one and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for me, and told me a Friend that was gone from <hi>Boſton</hi> to <hi>Rode Iſland</hi> had left me his houſe to ſojourn in; to which we went, and two Families more with us, who went ſuddenly to their Friends and other Relations in the Countrey, and I being poor was neceſſitated to work daily with my Howe, for the ſpace of almoſt three weeks. The Magiſtrates were told by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that I was an <hi>Antinomian,</hi> and deſired they would not ſuffer me to abide in their Patent: But within the time limited by their Law in that Caſe, two Strangers coming to <hi>Boſton</hi> from <hi>Piſcattuah,</hi> hearing of me by a meer Accident, got me to go with them to that Plantation, and to preach there, where I remained about four years, and then being ſent for back to <hi>England</hi> by

my aged Father, I returned with my Wife and one Child about three years old, and ſhe was great with another Child, and we came ſafe to <hi>London</hi> on the 24th. of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 1641. in which Year the <hi>Maſſacre</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> broke forth, and the next Year Wars brake forth in <hi>England</hi> between King and Parliament: I was ſtill poor, and ſojourned in a Lodging till I had but ſixpence left, and knew not how to provide for my Wife and Child, but having prayed to God, and encouraged my Wife to truſt in God, and to remember former Experiences, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially that Word of promiſe, God had given us, and would perform to us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. having paid for my Lodging, I went out not knowing whither Gods good hand of Providence would lead me to receive ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards my preſent Subſiſtence. And about ſeven or eight doors from my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Woman met me in the Street, and told me ſhe came to ſeek me, and her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſent her to tell me, that there was a Lodging provided and prepared in his houſe by ſome Chriſtian Friends for me and my Wife: I told her my preſent Condition, and went along with her to her houſe, and there ſhe gave me 20 <hi>s.</hi> which Dr. <hi>Baſtwick</hi> a late Sufferer had given her for me, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41774:13"/>
ſome Linnens for my Wife, which I received, and told her and her Husband I would fetch my Wife and Child, and lodge there: and ſo I returned with great joy, and my Wife was very much affected with this Mercy and Divine Providence, being ſo ſuitable and ſeaſonable a ſupply unto us, and ſhe ſaid, Oh dear Husband, how ſweet is it to live by Faith, and truſt God upon his bare Word: Let us rely upon him whilſt we live, and truſt him in all Straits; with many ſuch like expreſſions. And after we had returned praiſes to God, we went to our new Lodging, where we found all things neceſſary provided for us, and all charges paid for 15 weeks, and my Wife being bruiſed much on Shipboard, had ſore Labour, and lay under great weakneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ten weeks, all which time two Do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctors, an Apothecary and a Chyrurgeon did daily attend her, and adminiſtred unto her freely without any Money, and at the end of 16 weeks, we had ſeven pounds that was given us by ſome Chriſtian Friends; I had ſpoken to ſome of thoſe Friends, to get me ſome Scholars, and I would get me a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place to teach School, for I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther work for my Bread, than be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Charity of good Chriſtians:

One morning came a Friend, and told me, a School-maſter on great <hi>Tower-hill</hi> dyed laſt night, and if I would come preſently, I might probably get ſome of his Scholars, ſo I went and got three or four Scholars that day, and there I had a great School, and continued till I was choſen Maſter of <hi>Mary-Axe</hi> Free-School, whither I carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſixty Scholars from great <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> and within one year I had above ſeven-ſcore Scholars, and ſixteen Boarders, which Free-School and all the Benefits thereof, I left to go into the Parliaments Army, and preached freely to the common Souldiers, till <hi>I did perceive the Commanders ſought their own things more than the Cauſe of God and his People, breaking their Vows and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Engagements.</hi> Whereupon I left the Army, and came to <hi>London</hi> again; ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the Committee for plundred Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſent their Warrant to the then Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in <hi>Ely</hi>-Houſe to apprehend me, and bring me in ſafe Cuſtody before them, who took me out of my Houſe, carried me to <hi>Ely</hi>-Houſe, and there kept me Priſoner ſeveral days, without any Bail, and at laſt carried me before the Committee: who asked me ſeveral Queſtions, to which I gave them ſober and direct Anſwers.

And I did not wholly neglect my Duty, as a Paſtor, but preached two or three times a week, and viſited the Members of the Church from houſe to houſe, eſpecially when they were ſick. And during twenty five years now paſt, the Church hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Apoſtles Doctrine, Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayer, without Diviſion and Separation of any part thereof, or Party therein: Though ſome few particular Members be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing led away by ſome Errour in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have forſaken the Aſſembling of themſelves with the Church, as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſome is, and was in the Apoſtles time. In the year 1660. upon <hi>Venners</hi> Riſing, and others that with him made an Inſurrection in the City of <hi>London,</hi> my ſelf and many other godly and peaceable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, were taken out of their own dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling houſes, and brought to <hi>Woodſtreet</hi>-Counter, and many to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Priſons, though we were innocent, and knew not of their Deſign; at which time I ſuffered Impriſonment 18 weeks, till
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41774:16"/>
we were delivered by an Act of Pardon upon the Kings Coronation, unto all Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, except Murderers. We were above four hundred Priſoners kept all this time in <hi>Newgate,</hi> becauſe we refuſed to take the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy. After I was ſet at Liberty out of Priſon, I went to <hi>Holland,</hi> and thence up into <hi>Germany,</hi> with my Wife and two of my Children, where we ſojourned about two or three years, and in my Abſence one Col. <hi>Legge,</hi> a Bed-chamber Man, and Lieutenant of the Ordnance, charged me in the Court of Exchequer for keeping a Houſe and Ground from the King, againſt whom I ſtood Suit by my Attorney: But when Col. <hi>Legge</hi> could not get my Houſe from me by Law, he and ſome others brought ſeveral Red Coat-Souldiers, and took it by force, thruſt out thoſe perſons I had left in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and kept Poſſeſſion by Souldiers, both of my Houſe, Garden, and my Goods, which had coſt me above 700 <hi>l.</hi> with the Purchaſe, bought of the Artillery Company of <hi>London,</hi> to whom I paid 300 <hi>l.</hi> and laid out 400 <hi>l.</hi> more in building upon the Ground, which I had bought and paid for. I had at the ſame time 200 <hi>l.</hi> in Weavers Hall, which was given away to the King,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41774:17"/>
among many greater Summs of other mens Money. I ſpent above 150 <hi>l.</hi> more in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> and when I had ſpent all that, I was forced to ſell all my Goods there, to bring me to <hi>England</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. In which Return I met with two remarkable Acts of Providence towards me, my Wife and two Children. I had agreed with a Skipper at <hi>Cullen</hi> in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> to <hi>Rotterdam</hi> for a Summ of Money, and he was to pay all the Tolls &amp; Licences which he did at two or three places, till we were come where we were Strangers, and then he made me pay Licences at 2 places, and at a place called <hi>Rurote,</hi> upon the River <hi>Rhyne</hi> he made me pay both Toll and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and kept me there two or three days at great Charges; and my Wife being ſet and very ſad in an Harbour or Victualling. houſe, came in a Gentleman, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of her, asked me what the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman ailed, I told him ſhe was my Wife, and he underſtanding the Latin Tongue, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ked me what the matter was; I told him all my Caſe, and what my Condition was; <hi>Well,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>if you be a Son of</hi> Abraham, <hi>God will deliver you;</hi> and ſo he went into his Chamber, and ſent for the Skipper and Toll Maſters, and cauſed him to produce
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41774:17"/>
our Agreement, and underſtanding how he had wronged one, he being Lord, and Chief, over the Tollmaſters there, he Commanded them to take our Goods from him, and to hire us another Skipper to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us and our Goods to <hi>Rotterdam:</hi> And made the Skipper that had done me wrong, to allow me ſo much as I had paid for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences all the way thither. After we were come to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and my Wife, and Son, and Daughter, were come to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> God made two Catholicks in <hi>Cullen,</hi> inſtrumental to prevail with the Prince <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit,</hi> to ſend me by a Bill of Exchange 160 Rix-Dollers, for a Houſe that I had Built in his Country, and could not Sell, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at <hi>Rotterdam;</hi> and then came over to <hi>England</hi> my ſelf, and came to my Wife and Children, whom I found at a Friends Houſe in <hi>London.</hi> Then I ſet upon teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing School again, and by Gods Bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my honeſt Labours, have provided things Honeſt, Neceſſary, and Convenient, for my Family. To my Eldeſt Son, I had given 60 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> during his Life, which he enjoyed above 21 Years ere he Died. To my next Son, that lived to be Married, I gave the full value of 250 <hi>l.</hi> in Money, Houſe, School, and Houſhold-Goods,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41774:18"/>
and left him 50 Scholars in his Schoal-Houſe. To my only Daughter then Living, I gave upon her Marriage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 300 <hi>l.</hi> in Money, Annuity, Plate, Linnen, and Houſhold-ſtuff, and left her Husband 50 Scholars in the ſaid School-Houſe, in Partnerſhip with my ſaid Son. To my youngeſt Son, that lived to be Married, I gave more than 300 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling, beſides it coſt me above 60 pounds in his Apprenticeſhip, and 40 <hi>l.</hi> afterwards.</p>
            <p>Thus my Heavenly Father made up my former Loſſes, with his future Bleſſings, even in outward Subſtance, beſides a good increaſe of Grace, and Experience, in the ſpace of 40 years, that I and my dear faithful Wife Lived together; we remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſeveral times with our whole Family, whereof once from <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>New-England:</hi> Once from <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Wales;</hi> twice from <hi>London</hi> into <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> once from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to <hi>Holland,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and thence to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and thence to <hi>London</hi> again. In which Removings, I gained great Experiences of Gods Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, Goodneſs, and Truth, in his great and precious Promiſes: And I have gained ſome experience of my own hearts deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41774:18"/>
and the power of my own Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ond the reigning power of Chriſt, and his Captivating and ſubduing my Sins, making Conqueſts of the Devil, World, and Sin, and then giving me the Victory: And cauſing me to Triumph, and to bleſs his moſt Holy Name. Three things made my latter Sufferings very eaſy to be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. 1. The former Straits and Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, which I had undergone with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. 2. The preſent lively acts and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Grace, eſpecially Faith, and Hope, under thoſe latter and greater Tryals. 3. The Light of Gods Countenance, and the full aſſurance of his Love, and of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life. I would not want thoſe experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and teachings, that my Soul hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed for all that ever I ſuffered.</p>
            <p>My Wilderneſs-Mercies, Sea-Mercies, City-Mercies, and Priſon-Mercies, affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me very many and ſtrong Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

               </gap> am a very unprofitable Servant, but yet, by Grace, I am what I am. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of my Miniſtry, I Studied in the Forenoon, and Viſited my Religious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in the Afternoon, and ſome of my natural Relations. I did Preach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly twice, often 3 times, and ſome Lords days 4 times; at <hi>Holton</hi> at 7 in the Morning, at <hi>Humberſton</hi> at 9, at <hi>Seartho</hi> at 11, at <hi>Humberſton</hi> at 3 a Clock, all in the ſame day; I alſo Preached every Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liday once, at every Burial, Poor or Rich. And I have moſt commonly Preached 3 or 4 times every Week, if in any meaſure of Health, for above 40 years togather, except now and then, I got ſome other
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41774:19"/>
Godly Man to Preach for me, but rarely. When I was in Priſon, I did Preach uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every day, if well. And God was pleaſed to confirm my Call unto that great Work, 1. By the Converſion of many Sinners, who having declared the deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God with their Souls, teſtified, God did convince them, convert them, and eſtabliſh many of them by my Miniſtry, through the powerful and effectual Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Holy Spirit, and Word preached by me unto them. 2. By ſome healing power of God, put forth upon the ſick and infirm Bodies of ſeveral perſons, who were ſuddainly reſtored to health, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately in time of Prayer with them, or by and through Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this City of <hi>London,</hi> and of the Sickneſs called the Plague, both in former years, and in the year 1665. Not to me, but to God, be given Glory and praiſe, for in his Name, through Faith in his Name, they were healed. 3. By in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling me, ſtanding by me, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning me, by his Holy Spirit, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Grace, to preach the Goſpel in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and out of ſeaſon, with all boldneſs, neither being aſhamed, nor afraid to bear my Teſtimony for Chriſt, his Goſpel,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41774:20"/>
Churches, Miniſtry, Worſhip, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, againſt the Antichriſtian Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Miniſters, Worſhippers, and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Beaſt, the great myſtical Whore, and the falſe Prophet. Nor have I been terrified by the Adverſary: By vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Acts of Parliament, touching private Meetings and Conventicles, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing <hi>May</hi> the 10th. 1670. I was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at a Meeting in <hi>George-yard,</hi> and the then Lord Mayor committed me to the Compter in <hi>Biſhops gate</hi> for preaching there, but having Favour in the Eyes of the Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, I had liberty to preach to the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners there, twice every day of the Week, in the common Hall, where moſt of the Priſoners came and heard me, and ſome of them bleſſed God, that ever I came to that Priſon. Soon after I was ſet at Liberty, at the Seſſions in <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> God made me his Priſoner, by a ſharp and painful Diſtemper in my Bowels, called the grip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Guts, and he brought me near to the Grave. But in time of my greateſt Extremity, God remembred Mercy, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave mine Iniquity, healed my Diſeaſe, and reſtored my Life from Death. No Tongue can expreſs my pains, yet God gave me much patience, wherein I poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41774:20"/>
my Soul. I had, 1. A very clear Diſcovery from the Lord of the Cauſe, why he ſo contended with me; one was the meritorious Cauſe of ſome former Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitations, and eſpecially of this ſore Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. 2. I ſaw the Sin of my ſinful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which was not ſo Crucified, as that it was deſtroyed, but I found ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it of late ſtirring in my ſinful heart. The Sence of this was a very ſore burden and trouble to my Soul in this day of my Calamity, for which I mourned in ſecret before the Lord, and lay at the Throne of Grace loathing my ſelf, and begging, that God would kill that Sin, and deſtroy it, and all the reſt of my Sins. And received this anſwer, his Grace was ſufficient for me, he had pardoned and he would ſubdue, and deſtroy that and all other mine Iniquities, according to his everlaſting Covenant of free Grace. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan was ſometimes very buſy during this time of Sickneſs, and tempted me ſorely in the Night ſeaſon, ſometimes ſuggeſting to me, that I was but an Hypocrite, at other times, that my Evidences for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven were not good, whom God helped me to reſiſt ſteadfaſtly in the Faith, and he fled away. Another cauſe why the Lord
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41774:21"/>
now contended with me, was for the Tryal and Exerciſe of my Graces, which he had given me. It was the Tryal of my Faith, and the exerciſe of my Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that I might be to his praiſe, and an example unto weak Believers, whoſe Eyes were upon me, and were obſerving and hearkning how I did behave my ſelf, under all the great Rebukes and Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord upon me. For they had heard, that God had taken one Grand-Child away by Death, and Viſited ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was above 16 years old with the Small-pox, and ſhe was likely to die, and one Son died and was Buried du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my Sickneſs; and mine Eldeſt Son was dead and Buried in the Country, whereof I was told before I was Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; my other Sons Wife had ſore La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, a Dead-Man-Child, and ſhe likely to die: And my dear loving Wife, then began to be ſorely afflicted with a pain and ſwelling in her Face, of which ſhe ſince Died.</p>
            <p>But God did give a proportionable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Faith and Patience to me his poor unworthy Servant, under all this his fatherly Chaſtiſements: He did ſtrengthen me with ſtrength in my Soul, and upheld me with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41774:21"/>
the right hand of his Righteouſneſs; ſo that I fainted not, nor was I weary: His Rod and his Staff did comfort me; He brought out my Will unto a free Submiſſion, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and Reſignation to his own moſt wiſe and holy Will. Yea, my Facher's Viſitations did ſo preſerve my Soul, that I did ſing and rejoyce under the ſights and ſmiles of Chriſt, even whilſt I was ſighing and ſorrowing for my tranſgreſſions.</p>
            <p>Two learned, well practiſed, and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Doctors of Phyſick had daily viſited me, and conſulted my Cure, ſereral days together, and I was fully perſwaded, that they did what poſſibly they could to effect a Cure: And knew alſo, that God did not ſucceed their honeſt and faithful Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours with his Bleſſing. Although God had given a ſignal and ſingular Teſtimony of his ſpecial Bleſſing by each of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others of their Patients, at leaſt ſixteen at the ſame time; I reſolved to take no more Phyſick, but would apply to that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ordinance of God appointed by Jeſus Chriſt, the great Phyſician of value, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.14, 15. And I got Mr. <hi>Kiffin</hi> &amp; Mr. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſor Powel,</hi> who prayed over me, and anointed me with Oyl in the Name of the Lord: And the Lord did hear Prayer, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41774:22"/>
heal me. For there were very many godly Miniſters and gracious Saints, that prayed day and night for me (with ſubmiſſion to the Will of God) that the Lord would ſpare my life and heal me, and make me more uſeful and ſerviceable to the Lord, to the Church, and to the Saints; whoſe Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers God heard, and as an Anſwer of their Prayers, I was perfectly healed, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained weak long after. My dear Wife remained weak and full of pain, and was very greatly afflicted with pain day and night, but the Lord gave her a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Faith and Patience even to the end; She enjoyed the Light of Gods Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, had full Aſſurance of Gods Love, the Pardon of her Sins, and of eternal Life; And having patiently endured ſix months ſore pains, upon the thirtieth of the ſecond month called <hi>April,</hi> 1671. being the Lords Day, about four or five a clock, ſlept in Jeſus: I was doing my Maſters Work at that time in the Congregation; and toward the end of my Sermon, had a ſtrong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe upon my Spirit, That my dear Wife was departing, and in my Prayer after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was drawn forth by Faith to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend her to God that gave her me, and bleſſed him for receiving her Soul into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:41774:22"/>
boſom, and placing her among the Spirits of juſt men made perfect in the Paradiſe of God.</p>
            <p>Since the death of my dear Wife, it hath pleaſed God to ſtretch forth his Hand upon my only Son then living, and to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict him with a deep Conſumption, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, as I judge, by Grief for his dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loving and beloved Mother, for he droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ever ſince ſhe firſt was taken ill of that Diſtemper of Rhume, which fell from her Head into her Face, of which ſhe dyed: And he hath been worſe and worſe ever ſince ſhe dyed. And I having had great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences and a great Charge of dear Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and owing ſome conſiderable debts, I was neceſſitated to teach School again in my old Age; That I might pay my Debts, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour my dear Relations, and not be too great a burden to the Church of God: And this I have willingly and chearfully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, that if Perſecution do come upon me again (which I expect and prepare for) and I ſhall be haled to priſon, or forced to flye: It may be my Mercy and Comfort as at all other times of my many removals in the days of my Pilgrlmage and Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; That no perſon ſhall have any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to come to me and ſay, <hi>Pay me what
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41774:23"/>
you owe me before you go; for I deſire to owe no man any thing but Love, and honeſtly to pay every man his own. And if Death ſeize on my body, that I may leave enough of my own behind me to pay all my Debts, and a little for the Relief of Gods Poor, and ſome of my pooreſt natural Relations.</hi> I had a Summoning in <hi>June</hi> laſt to prepare my ſelf for the Grave by a ſudden and ſore Fit of the Wind-Cholick and Vomiting. And on the 3d of <hi>October</hi> laſt, 1671. I had another Summons to be ready to depart this life by another ſudden more violent tormenting Fit of the Wind-Cholick and Vomiting. And I am alarmed by theſe awakening Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitations of the Lord to prepare and be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; That when my Lord and Maſter comes or calls for me to come to him, I may be found ſo doing, that he may ſay, <hi>Well done, thou good and faithful Servant, enter thou alſo into the Joys of thy Maſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Tryal my heavenly Father ſaw needful for me to be exerciſed under, was the Sickneſs and Death of my then only living Son, my <hi>Iſaac,</hi> my moſt loving and beloved Son, who was tranſlated the 15th. day of <hi>November,</hi> 1671. which great Tryal and Loſs God made gain to him, and eaſie to me by a manifeſt and powerful Work
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41774:23"/>
of Converſion, Repentance and Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Soul in the time of his Sickneſs, which adminiſtred much Comfort to me, ſo that I ſorrowed not for him as one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope, who exerciſed very great pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence under his very great pain, ſoreneſs, and burning Feaver, whilſt his fleſh, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and moiſture conſumed, and acted Faith and Hope very lively and conſtantly upon Chriſt in that Word, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>And him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt off:</hi> Very often expreſſing his former bondage and ſlavery to Sin and Sathan, which he bewailed; and acknowledged often Gods free and rich Grace in giving him Chriſt and Pardon and Salvation now at laſt, which he had neglected the Offers and Tenders of ſo often. Some Combats he had, but after a manifeſtation of Chriſt to his Soul, he dyed in Faith and Peace.</p>
            <p>And albeit my natural Affections cauſed me to weep often, and the ſenſe of Gods Hand &amp; Rod upon me, cauſed me to mourn very much in ſecret; yet the Almighty by his Rod and Staff did ſo comfort me, that I walked through this Valley alſo of the ſhadow of Death without fear of Evil, and was aſſiſted and enabled to perform the Work of my Miniſtry in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41774:24"/>
without any omiſſion or interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And that very Night my only Son dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Lord brought to my mind that Scripture, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Feed thy people with thy Rod;</hi> which was made a ſeaſonable, ſuitable, and powerful Word by the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the holy Spirit unto my Soul, in my ſolitary Condition: Who thus adminiſtred Food, yea and a Feaſt alſo to my Soul. For by this Rod of God, I had ſerved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Soul a Diſh of ſour or bitter Herbs, I mean ſorrow for my ſins; but I fed alſo on the Paſchal Lamb, in whole blood I ſaw all my ſins waſhed away: And the Spirit of God witneſſed with my Spirit, that I was the Child of God, and one of thoſe Children, with whom God will keep Covenant, and not take away his Love from me, though he viſited my Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with the Rod, and mine iniquities with ſtripes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.28—34. which Scripture was then brought again with power upon my Heart. The next Diſh of ſpiritual Food under this Rod which God brought me, or ſent me by his Spirit in his Word to feed upon, was full of Love; Then that holy Scripture came to me, not in word only, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19, 20. but in Power and in the Spirit, and in much Aſſurance; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41774:24"/>
in he ſhewed me his Face, and I ſaw my Fathers Face in that Glaſs of the Goſpel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6, 7. which the holy Spirit held forth to me by this Rod, and ſhed abroad in my heart the Love of the Father in his Son Jeſus Chriſt. After this the next day God gave me a Diſh of ſpiritual Fruits by this Rod to feed upon, ſerved up in that holy Scripture, <hi>No affliction at the preſent is joyous, but grievous; but the fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhall be peace and righteouſneſs to them that have been exerciſed therein.</hi> And after God had thus fed me, feaſted me ſeveral days and nights together with this his Rod, he very graciouſly pronounced his Bleſſing upon me by his Rod, in theſe words; <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the man whom thou correcteſt and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt out of thy Law or Word, unto which I was helped heartily to ſay Amen:</hi> It's good for me to be, and that I have been afflicted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And after God had communed with me from his Mercy-ſeat, and had inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, I experienced ſuch Divine Loves, ſhinings, and ſpiritual ſweetneſs, as <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> did when he taſted a little Honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew on the End of the Rod in his hand; and was enlightned and refreſhed. So that I was enlivened, or revived, fed and feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Rod and Word, even the Bond

of Gods everlaſting Covenant of free Grace, and Love.</p>
            <p>About 4 or 5 months after the Death of my Son, his Wife married a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of 300 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> and left me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to receive and pay all my Sons Debts; and to preſerve his Credit and his Wife's, I borrowed 200 <hi>l.</hi> to help to pay his Debts, and ſuffered the loſs thereof, which neceſſitated me ſtill to keep School to pay my Debts: And I having a Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daughter with me three years before, ſhe being nineteen years old, did take the Charge of my Houſhold-affairs, and of my Boarders, who managed all things with ſo much diſcretion, that my life was very comfortable, and I had great Content. In <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1672. my only Daughters Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band went by her conſent into the Country, and left her.</p>
            <p>Thus far was written with his own hand; and there we muſt be forced to break off, tho' abruptly, the remaining part of his Life, written by himſelf, as this was, being, as Mr. <hi>Kiffin</hi> mentions in his Preface, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily loſt: which, becauſe 'tis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mpoſſible to be ſupplied by any Hand ſo particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as his own, muſt be done in general, by letting the Chriſtian Reader know, That
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41774:25"/>
this holy Man's Life was all of a piece, and that he maintained his Zeal, Fidelity, and Integrity in the latter part of it, as well as in the former, even to the end of it. He was not very long ſick; not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Chamber above five weeks, nor his Bed above ten days. All the time of his Sickneſs he behaved himſelf with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Patience, and Reſignation to the Divine Will, longing to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt; not ſo much to be freed from Pain and Trouble, as from Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; which he expreſſed to one with him, with a more than ordinary Tranſport of Joy. A little before his Death, he wrote the following Epiſtle, which he left as his laſt Legacy to the Church.</p>

            <head>Mr. <hi>Knollys</hi>'s laſt Legacy to the Church, written a little before his Death.</head>
            <head>To the Church whereof I am Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, Grace, Love, and Peace, by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord and Saviour, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HOly Brethren, Partakers of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Calling, I not being able to Preach any more unto you, do take liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by writing to give you this as my laſt Counſel, and I hope the whole Church will ſeriouſly conſider what I have written, as the laſt words of your very aged Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, whoſe departure, as I hope, is at hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:41774:26"/>Firſt of all, I do humbly beſeech my Reverend and Beloved Brother <hi>Steed,</hi> for Chriſts ſake, that the fervent Love to the Church, and the watchful Care over the particular Members of it, Expreſſed and Publiſhed in his little Epiſtle touching Singing, may be revived; and alſo that the Brotherly Love of the Miniſtring Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and likewiſe of all my beloved Brethren, who are helps in Government, may be ſtirred up to Help, to Aſſiſt, to provoke the reſt unto good Works, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.18.</p>
            <p>Now I do unfeignedly, and without vain boaſting, commend many of you, my beloved Brethren and Siſters, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip in breaking of Bread, and in Prayer, (but as for the reſt, who forſake the aſſembling of themſelves, with rhe Church on the Lords Day, I commend them not,) eſpecially not only in this time of Liberty, but when it was a time of violent Perſecution, when I was ſhut up a Year and four Months, (bleſſed be God for Priſon Mercies,) in <hi>New-Priſon.</hi> And having mentioned that time of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, can I paſs it by without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41774:27"/>
the conſtant Aſſembling of our Brethren and Siſters all that time, every Lords day to worſhip God? And may I not with great Comfort, commend the Labour of Love of our Miniſtring Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, in the Work and Doctrine of the Goſpel, without ceaſing, (as you well know,) and among whom they ſtill la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and faint not. And now ſome of our younger Brethren, begin to improve their Gifts and Talents for the Glory of God, and the Edification of the Church, whom I deſire may be encouraged.</p>
            <p>Another thing very commendable in this Church, is the Charity, which they have added to their <hi>Brotherly kindneſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. It was great Brotherly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which was manifeſted to the Church, by thoſe Brethren who lookt out our Meeting-Houſe, and prepared it for us as it now is: And unto this, many of our Brethren and Siſters, have added their Charity in a free and very liberal Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and Contribution, given into the Truſtees of the Fund: And I hope they will be ready to do the like again, when the like Neceſſities call for it. Read I pray you the 8th. and 9th. Chapters of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41774:27"/>
the ſecond Epiſtle unto the Church of <hi>Corinth:</hi> All this, and much more, are the Riches of Grace, which God hath freely given by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, unto this Church for his own Glory.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, I muſt in Love and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to your precious and gracious Souls, (holy and beloved,) tell you of ſome things, not to ſhame you, (for I my ſelf am found guilty as well as you, and more than ſome of you,) but to warn you, and to counſel you, (as a Father doth his Children,) and they are theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That ſeveral of us are fallen in ſome degree, from our firſt Love, cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Spiritual Affections to Jeſus Chriſt, and to the Saints. —Muſt not you and I confeſs, that it is not with us now, as it was in the day of our firſt Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals? God the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit remembers it. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.1, 2. And we ſhould remember from <hi>whence we are fallen,</hi> and ſhould ſay, <hi>I will go and return unto my firſt Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, for then was it better with me, than now, Hoſ.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4, 5.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:41774:28"/>Now the firſt part of my Counſel, which I deſire to take and receive from Chriſt, and to give unto you, my dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved Brethren and Siſters, who are convinced, and have confeſſed it before the Lord, on ſeveral days of Faſting and Prayer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I do Counſel you to Repent, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5. And I muſt tell you, Beloved, that our aſſembling once in four Weeks, and ſpending four hours, from Eleven to Three, in Praying and Preaching, as we have often done, is not ſuch a Faſt as will make our Voice be heard on High, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.3, 4. Several things are eſſentially neceſſary to Evangelical Repentance, that it may be acceptable unto God by Jeſus Chriſt. —Namely, Godly Sorrow, which worketh Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, never to be repented of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9, 10. A broken Contrite Spirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17. <hi>James</hi> 4.9, 10. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.2, 3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. Read theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10, 11. Alas, where are our Tears of Godly Sorrow, our broken Hearts, and our afflicted Souls? Reformation after Humiliation? Repent and do thy firſt Works, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41774:28"/>
O Holy Brethren, let us do ſo, let you and I beg Grace, that we may both Mourn and turn from all our Sins, to the Lord with all our Hearts.</p>
            <p>We have cauſe to repent of our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, and <hi>Laodicean</hi> Lukewarmneſs, eſpecially for want of zeal for the Houſe of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.12, 13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.17.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I Counſel you to be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: Zeal is a fervent and conſtant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a gracious Soul, in a good thing, managed with Diſcretion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.18. If our zeal be not fixed upon a right Object, and good Matter; it may be hot, and great, but it cannot be good. Compare the zeal of <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3.6. with the zeal of <hi>Epaphras, Col.</hi> 4.12, 13.</p>
            <q>To guide our zeal aright, two things eſpecially ought to accompany it.</q>
            <p>Firſt, The light of Knowledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3. Read the words again and again, and as often as you read this Paper. Many profeſſours of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41774:29"/>
Law then, were very zealous of Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing their own Legal Righteouſneſs, and many profeſſors of the Goſpel, now, are as zealous, to eſtabliſh their own Legal Righteouſneſs, and not Chriſts. O! ſay ſome, If I could pray ſo, mourn ſo as others do; if I were ſo Holy and ſo Humble, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then I would believe. O! ſay others, if I could get power over my Corruptions, and ſtrength againſt Satans Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Victory over the allurements of this preſent evil World, then I would believe: But I have a Heart full of vile affections, vain thoughts and doubts, that I cannot believe.</p>
            <p>Conſider, Are Praying, Mourning, Humbling our Souls, Goſpel Duties? even ſo is believing a Goſpel Duty, which God Commands, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. And he threatens to Damn them that hear the Goſpel preached, and will not believe, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.41.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Aim and End of our Zeal, muſt always be the Glory of God, and guided, as I ſaid, by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion: Wiſe as well as Warm: Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41774:29"/>
zeal, in greateſt Matters, and leſſer zeal in leſſer matters. Compare, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.11, 13. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13, 14, 15, 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.11.</p>
            <p>My Counſel alſo is, and I humbly beſeech our honoured and beloved El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and entreat our Miniſtring Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who are Helps in Government, to joyn together to ſet in Order theſe things.</p>
            <p>I mean no other things, than thoſe holy Adminiſtrations which Chriſt, his Apoſtles, and Diſciples, practiſed in the beginning. Search theſe Scriptures, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Acts</hi> 28.23, 24,—28, 29, 30, 31. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.13, 23, 24, 25, 29. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.16. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.27. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.3. Conſider, holy Brethren, that as Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and Expounding are two different Adminiſtrations, ſo are Prophecying and Preaching, yet both Goſpel Ordinances, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6, 7.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and Laſtly, My Counſel to the Church is, that you will look out
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41774:30"/>
a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, whom he hath in ſome competent meaſure, qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch Miniſterial Gifts and Graces as may make him worthy of ſo great honour, as is due to a Paſtor, and Elder of the Church of God, yea, of double honour, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. Both of Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Obedience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17.</p>
            <p>And now my dearly beloved Brethren and Siſters, I commit you all to the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an Inheritance among them which are Sanctified. So I remain, while in this Tabernacle,</p>
